"""Steering trace: records where steering was actually applied.

Enabled by setting the VLLM_STEER_TRACE_DIR environment variable to a
directory. Each worker process appends JSONL records:

- {"type": "step", "step": N, "req_ids": [...], "slots": [...],
   "query_start_loc": [...], "token_ids": [...],
   "num_computed": [...], "num_output": [...]}
  emitted once per engine step by the model runner (batch composition).

- {"type": "apply", "step": N, "layer": L, "slot": S, "algo": name,
   "positions": [...]}
  emitted by each steered layer with the exact flat token positions that
  were transformed for that slot.

Joining the two record types gives, for every step: which requests were
in the batch, their token ranges and token ids, and exactly which
positions each config steered at each layer. Used by the Phase C trigger
validation tests; also useful for debugging steering behavior. Tracing
is off unless the env var is set; overhead (GPU syncs) only occurs when
enabled.
